"# Clickbait-Detection" 

This project is for the course Information Retrieval, TU Delft. 

We have created a system that takes tweets' data as input and classifies them as clickbait or no-clickbait. We have used dataset from Clickbait Detection Challenge 2017. More informtaion about this can be found out on:
http://www.clickbait-challenge.org/


To run the code, create a branch and open file NLP_Project.py

Required packages are mentioned in comments of file NLP_Project.py

We used Spyder IDE for code execution. 

Due to limited computation capability of our systems, we have used smaller dataset. Bigger dataset is in folder "clickbait17-validation-170630", change location of dataset to use this dataset.
