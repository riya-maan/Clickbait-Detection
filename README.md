"# Clickbait-Detection" 
 This project is for the course Information Retrieval, TU Delft. We have created it as a part of our curriculum. We have used dataset from Clickbait Detection Challenge 2017 (http://www.clickbait-challenge.org/). 

To run the code, create a branch and open file NLP_Project.py

Required packages are mentioned in comments of file NLP_Project.py

We have used Spyder IDE for code execution. 

Due to limited computation capability of our systems, we have used smaller dataset. Bigger dataset is in folder "clickbait17-validation-170630", change location of dataset to use this dataset.
